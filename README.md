# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Major-Project
## Context -
Credit card fraud detection is the process of identifying purchase attempts that are fraudulent and rejecting them rather than processing the order. There are a variety of tools and techniques available for detecting fraud, with most merchants employing a combination of several of them.
## What are the two types of credit card fraud -
### Hacking:
Thieves can hack companies with whom you have had transactions or firms that perform credit card processing activities. They will then engage in data breaches. 
### Phishing:
Phishing includes the persuading of consumers to provide their sensitive data by tricking them by the scammers.
